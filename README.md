# CENG 2002 - Programming Language Concepts 
This is the sharing repo for CENG 2002 course offered in MSKU [Department of Computer Engineering](http://bilmuh.mu.edu.tr/).

Usage:

* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). To start using git you may check the [simple tutorials](https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=git+simple+tutorial) first, then you can dig deeper.
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pembeci/ceng2002.git`
* You can get the latest updates by giving this command in your cloned git directory: `git pull` 
* For your experiments create a branch and switch to it: `git checkout -b hobara`
* Later you can delete the branch with: `git branch -d hobara`
* If you are working on a branch, to get the latest files first you need to return to the master branch: 

  ```
        git checkout -b master` # switch to master branch 
        git pull  # get latest updates
  ```      
* Instead of cloning and creating branches, you may also fork this repo with your github account and then work on your local copy. You need to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) after I added new files.
